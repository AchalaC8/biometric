its a project to analyse the biometric data
Automated Attendance Notification System
This project is a Python-based solution designed to automate attendance monitoring and send notifications to students who have not completed their biometric check-in. The system reads daily attendance data from CSV files, identifies absent students, and is configured to send automated alerts.

Features
Daily CSV Processing: The script dynamically identifies and processes the current day's attendance data from a CSV file (e.g., 01-Jun-2025.csv).

Absentee Identification: It efficiently filters the data to find all students with a "Not Present" status.

Automated Notifications: The core function, send_notification, is a placeholder for integrating with a real-world messaging API (like Twilio) to send automated alerts via SMS or email to absent students.

Customizable Logic: The script can be easily adapted to handle different data formats, notification times, or contact methods.

How It Works
The script is intended to be executed once daily by a scheduling tool (such as cron on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows) at a predetermined time.

The check_for_absent_students() function is called.

It constructs the expected filename for the current date.

It reads the corresponding CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

The DataFrame is filtered to find all rows where the Status is 'Not Present'.

It then iterates through the list of absent students.

For each absent student, the send_notification() function is triggered. In this current version, it prints a message to the console, but this is where you would integrate your messaging API to send a real notification.

Setup and Usage
To use this script, you need to have the necessary Python libraries installed.

Prerequisites
You can install the required library using pip:

pip install pandas

Configuration
Attendance Data: Ensure your daily attendance data is in a CSV file named in the DD-Mon-YYYY.csv format (e.g., 13-Sep-2025.csv).

Contact Information: To send real notifications, you would need to add a column with student contact information (e.g., Phone Number or Email) to your CSV files.

API Integration: To send actual notifications, you must replace the placeholder code in the send_notification function with the logic for your chosen messaging API (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid). You will need to obtain an API key and follow their documentation.

Running the Script
This script is designed to be run as a scheduled task, but you can also run it manually from your terminal:

python notification_system.py

Potential Enhancements
Database Integration: Instead of reading from a CSV, connect to a database to handle attendance records, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates.

Error Logging: Implement a robust logging system to record any errors that occur during the process, such as a missing file or a failed API call.

Multi-Day Analysis: Modify the script to analyze data across multiple days to identify long-term absenteeism patterns.
