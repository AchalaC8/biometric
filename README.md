<h1>Automated Attendance Notification System</h1>
<p>This project is a Python-based solution designed to automate attendance monitoring and send notifications to students who have not completed their biometric check-in. The system reads daily attendance data from CSV files, identifies absent students, and is configured to send automated alerts.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Daily CSV Processing:</strong> The script dynamically identifies and processes the current day's attendance data from a CSV file (e.g., 01-Jun-2025.csv).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Absentee Identification:</strong> It efficiently filters the data to find all students with a "Not Present" status.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Automated Notifications:</strong> The core function, <code>send_notification</code>, is a placeholder for integrating with a real-world messaging API (like Twilio) to send automated alerts via SMS or email to absent students.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Customizable Logic:</strong> The script can be easily adapted to handle different data formats, notification times, or contact methods.
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The script is intended to be executed once daily by a scheduling tool (such as cron on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows) at a predetermined time.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>check_for_absent_students()</code> function is called.</li>
<li>It constructs the expected filename for the current date.</li>
<li>It reads the corresponding CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.</li>
<li>The DataFrame is filtered to find all rows where the <code>Status</code> is 'Not Present'.</li>
<li>It then iterates through the list of absent students.</li>
<li>For each absent student, the <code>send_notification()</code> function is triggered. In this current version, it prints a message to the console, but this is where you would integrate your messaging API to send a real notification.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Setup and Usage</h2>
<p>To use this script, you need to have the necessary Python libraries installed.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You can install the required library using <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pandas</code></pre>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Attendance Data:</strong> Ensure your daily attendance data is in a CSV file named in the DD-Mon-YYYY.csv format (e.g., 13-Sep-2025.csv).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contact Information:</strong> To send real notifications, you would need to add a column with student contact information (e.g., Phone Number or Email) to your CSV files.
</li>
<li>
<strong>API Integration:</strong> To send actual notifications, you must replace the placeholder code in the <code>send_notification</code> function with the logic for your chosen messaging API (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid). You will need to obtain an API key and follow their documentation.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Running the Script</h3>
<p>This script is designed to be run as a scheduled task, but you can also run it manually from your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>python notification_system.py</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Potential Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Database Integration:</strong> Instead of reading from a CSV, connect to a database to handle attendance records, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Error Logging:</strong> Implement a robust logging system to record any errors that occur during the process, such as a missing file or a failed API call.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Multi-Day Analysis:</strong> Modify the script to analyze data across multiple days to identify long-term absenteeism patterns.
</li>
</ul>
